It is a simple web-app that I made to practice **React.js**. The app will render a multi-page Form and take user details and on completion, it will render all the details taken.

This project is a simple **multi-page user form web application** built with **React.js**, designed to practice front-end development skills. The app allows users to input personal and specific details across multiple steps, with the ability to navigate between form pages. It features **dynamic state management using React hooks**, ensuring a smooth user experience. The form validates inputs for accuracy and displays a confirmation screen for users to review their entries before submission. Upon completion, all entered details are displayed on a success page. The project follows responsive design principles, making it accessible on various devices.
